      <p>Took some time out of my day to add some stuff I had thought of/put off doing. If you can't tell, there are social media links in the navigation bar. Clicking/pressing will lead you to the accounts I use. The Discord link copies the tag to your clipboard. Hooray for ClipboardJS! Made each post into its own segment of its own. Now they all have their own personal space.</p>
      <p>Lastly, added some subtitles underneath the main title in the navigation bar. So far there are barely any that you can refresh 10 times and there's a good chance you've already seen all of them. I'll add somemore in one fell swoop on the repo.</p>
      <p>Just a little blog post to update on the new things I added onto the website. As always, have a good day.</p>

      <p>Yet another redesign I've done. I've done about 4 or 5 redesigns of this website at this point. I mostly made this website/blog as a placeholder if I ever think of something cool or innovative I can show off on here. At the moment, not much.</p>
      <p>To fill the void of this barren post, I'd like to share some projects I really like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://starpelly.com/blog/gridbeats">Starpelly</a>
          <p>Someone I know's blog where he's developing a rhythm game, GridBeats.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://robotop.xyz">RoboTop</a>
          <p>Super cool bot with a lot of features that are really nice to have. Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealGDColon">Colon</a>. Top tier bot to have just for its general use cases and fun server-wide commands like <code>r!place</code>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It'll probably be a while till I update this website again (hopefully not another full redesign). Until then, take care.</p>
