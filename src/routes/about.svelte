<h1 class="title">Hey. I'm Josef. (aka <em>jacktrepping</em>)</h1>
<p>I've been interested in programming, general computer science related topics, web development, and software development for a while. I don't have much to show at the moment. But hey, it's the thought that counts, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>See the links in the navigation bar to check some more stuff out. Or not. I'm not your parents.</p>
<p>You could follow me on Twitter too (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacktrepping">@jacktrepping</a>). I don't post a lot about my small dev logs on there. I might just make a sh**ty remake of Twitter by making a microblogging part on this site so no one has to see the more boring part of my account.</p>
<p>Also you might know me from the Scott the Woz shitposts. If you're that guy.</p>
