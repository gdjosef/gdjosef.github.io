Took some time out of my day to add some stuff I had thought of/put off doing. If you can't tell, there are social media links in the navigation bar. Clicking/pressing will lead you to the accounts I use. The Discord link copies the tag to your clipboard. Hooray for ClipboardJS! Made each post into its own segment of its own. Now they all have their own personal space.

Lastly, added some subtitles underneath the main title in the navigation bar. So far there are barely any that you can refresh 10 times and there's a good chance you've already seen all of them. I'll add somemore in one fell swoop on the repo.

Just a little blog post to update on the new things I added onto the website. As always, have a good day.
