Yet another redesign I've done. I've done about 4 or 5 redesigns of this website at this point. I mostly made this website/blog as a placeholder if I ever think of something cool or innovative I can show off on here. At the moment, not much.

To fill the void of this barren post, I'd like to share some projects I really like:

  - [Starpelly](https://starpelly.com)
  
  Someone I know's blog where he's developing a rhythm game, GridBeats.

  - [RoboTop](https://robotop.xyz)
  
  Super cool bot with a lot of features that are really nice to have. Created by Colon. Top tier bot to have just for its general use cases and fun server-wide commands like r!place.

It'll probably be a while till I update this website again (hopefully not another full redesign). Until then, take care.
