title: New design. Yet again.

Well. We're in this predicament again. New design, I admit, looks like an extremely generic SSG blog site. But hey, I switched it to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com). Took me about 2 weeks to code this excluding learning Svelte itself. Now also means that every blog post (only two, really) is now outdated. Sucks. Don't really care. Still not on about this layout I've come up with, I could always change it up.

Either way, that's enough for today. As always, have a nice day.
