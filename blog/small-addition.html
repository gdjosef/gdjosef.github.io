      <p>Took some time out of my day to add some stuff I had thought of/put off doing. If you can't tell, there are social media links in the navigation bar. Clicking/pressing will lead you to the accounts I use. The Discord link copies the tag to your clipboard. Hooray for ClipboardJS! Made each post into its own segment of its own. Now they all have their own personal space.</p>
      <p>Lastly, added some subtitles underneath the main title in the navigation bar. So far there are barely any that you can refresh 10 times and there's a good chance you've already seen all of them. I'll add somemore in one fell swoop on the repo.</p>
      <p>Just a little blog post to update on the new things I added onto the website. As always, have a good day.</p>
